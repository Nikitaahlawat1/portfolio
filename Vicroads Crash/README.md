# Cyclesafe Melbourne<

## Project Overview 
The growing climate crisis and rising environmental awareness are driving a shift towards sustainable transportation in cities like Melbourne. There is a current need for the City of Melbourne to prosper urban planning that creates safe, affordable and resilient cities with green and environmental living conditions. While cycling offers a clean and healthy way to get around, concerns about safety due to heavy traffic and limited cycling infrastructure deter many commuters. How can we encourage Victorians to embrace cycling as a safer and more eco-conscious commuting option?
