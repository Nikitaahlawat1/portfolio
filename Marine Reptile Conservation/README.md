## Project Overview

The project aims to create an interactive and educational website focused on marine conservation in Australia. The platform will provide users with vital resources and tools which include marine plastic pollution, information about endangered marine reptiles like sea turtles, tools for testing marine knowledge, a role play game about sea turtles, a system that can identify and track users’ contribution about marine conservation and information about the plastic process facilities. This website aims to empower marine conscious individuals to put more effort into marine conservation  and raise the public awareness of protecting the ocean.
