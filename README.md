# Data Science Portfolio
Hi, I'm Nikita Ahlawat, - Data Scientist

I am a Data Scientist with a Master’s in Data Science and a diverse background across analytics, business intelligence, and technology operations. I specialise in turning complex data into predictive models, insights, and clear narratives that inform decision-making.
My experience spans machine learning, data engineering, visualisation, and cross-functional collaboration—working with stakeholders from operational teams through to business leaders.
I enjoy building reproducible analytical workflows, improving data quality, and presenting insights in a way that non-technical audiences can quickly understand.
